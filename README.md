# Instructions

## Saint Brigid's Cross

Traditionally the St. Brigid's Cross is made of rushes. Tools needed for creation are a knife or a scissor only. Ignore the tin whistles on the picture shown. You won't believe it but these are definitively not needed here. To avoid scratches on the table you could decide to use a place mat, too.
